Why do we make guesses? We makeguesses when we wish to make a judgment but have incomplete information or uncertainknowledge. We want to make a guess as to what things are, or what things are likely tohappen. Often we wish to make a guess because we have to make a decision. Forexample: Shall I take my raincoat with me tomorrow? For what earth movement should Idesign a new building? Shall I build myself a fallout shelter? Shall I change my stand ininternational negotiations? Shall I go to class today?\\nSometimes we make guesses because we wish, with our limited knowledge, to say asmuch as we can about some situation. Really, any generalization is in the nature of aguess. Any physical theory is a kind of guesswork. There are good guesses and there arebad guesses. The theory of probability is a system for making better guesses. Thelanguage of probability allows us to speak quantitatively about some situation which maybe highly variable, but which does have some consistent average behavior.\\nLet us consider the Ô¨Çipping of a coin. If the toss‚Äîand the coin‚Äîare ‚Äúhonest,‚Äù we haveno way of knowing what to expect for the outcome of any particular toss. Yet we wouldfeel that in a large number of tosses there should be about equal numbers of heads andtails. We say: ‚ÄúThe probability that a toss will land heads is\\xa0.‚Äù\\nWe speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being made in thefuture. By the ‚Äúprobability‚Äù of a particular outcome of an observation we mean ourestimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yieldthat particular outcome. If we imagine repeating an observation‚Äîsuch as looking at afreshly tossed coin‚Äî\\xa0times, and if we call  our estimate of the most likely numberof our observations that will give some speciÔ¨Åed result\\xa0, say the result ‚Äúheads,‚Äù then by\\xa0, the probability of observing\\xa0, we mean\\nOur deÔ¨Ånition requires several comments. First of all, we may speak of a probability ofsomething happening only if the occurrence is a possible outcome of some repeatableobservation. It is not clear that it would make any sense to ask: ‚ÄúWhat is the probabilitythat there is a ghost in that house?‚Äù\\nYou may object that no situation is exactly repeatable. That is right. Every differentobservation must at least be at a different time or place. All we can say is that the‚Äúrepeated‚Äù observations should, for our intended purposes, appear to be equivalent. Weshould assume, at least, that each observation was made from an equivalently preparedsituation, and especially with the same degree of ignorance at the start. (If we sneak alook at an opponent‚Äôs hand in a card game, our estimate of our chances of winning aredifferent than if we do not!)\\nWe should emphasize that  and\\xa0  in Eq.\\xa0(6.1) are not intended to represent numbersbased on actual observations.  is our best estimate of what would occur in\\xa0imagined observations. Probability depends, therefore, on our knowledge and on ourability to make estimates. In effect, on our common sense! Fortunately, there is a certainamount of agreement in the common sense of many things, so that different people willmake the same estimate. Probabilities need not, however, be ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù numbers. Sincethey depend on our ignorance, they may become different if our knowledge changes.\\nYou may have noticed another rather ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù aspect of our deÔ¨Ånition of probability.We have referred to\\xa0 as ‚Äúour estimate of the most likely number ‚Ä¶‚Äù We do not meanthat we expect to observe exactly\\xa0 , but that we expect a number near\\xa0 , and that thenumber\\xa0 is more likely than any other number in the vicinity.

It is theproblem of the ‚Äúrandom walk.‚Äù In its simplest version, we imagine a ‚Äúgame‚Äù in which a‚Äúplayer‚Äù starts at the point\\xa0 and at each ‚Äúmove‚Äù is required to take a step eitherforward (toward\\xa0) or backward (toward\\xa0). The choice is to be made randomly,determined, for example, by the toss of a coin. How shall we describe the resultingmotion? In its general form the problem is related to the motion of atoms (or otherparticles) in a gas‚Äîcalled Brownian motion‚Äîand also to the combination of errors inmeasurements. You will see that the random-walk problem is closely related to the coin-tossing problem we have already discussed.\\nFirst, let us look at a few examples of a random walk. We may characterize the walker‚Äôsprogress by the net distance\\xa0 traveled in \\xa0steps. We show in the graph of Fig.\\xa06‚Äì5three examples of the path of a random walker. (We have used for the random sequenceof choices the results of the coin tosses shown in Fig.\\xa06‚Äì1.)\\nFig. 6‚Äì5.The progress made in a random walk. The horizontal coordinate\\xa0 is the totalnumber of steps taken; the vertical coordinate\\xa0 is the net distance moved from thestarting position.\\nWhat can we say about such a motion? We might Ô¨Årst ask: ‚ÄúHow far does he get on theaverage?‚Äù We must expect that his average progress will be zero, since he is equallylikely to go either forward or backward. But we have the feeling that as\\xa0 increases, heis more likely to have strayed farther from the starting point.

Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of itsvapor escape into the air. If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currentswill also carry the vapor with them. But even in perfectly still air, the vapor willgradually spread out‚Äîwill diffuse‚Äîuntil it has penetrated throughout the room. Wemight detect it by its color or odor. The individual molecules of the organic vapor spreadout in still air because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with othermolecules. If we know the average ‚Äústep‚Äù size, and the number of steps taken per second,we can Ô¨Ånd the probability that one, or several, molecules will be found at some distancefrom their starting point after any particular passage of time. As time passes, more stepsare taken and the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig.\\xa06‚Äì7. In a laterchapter, we shall Ô¨Ånd out how the step sizes and step frequencies are related to thetemperature and pressure of a gas.\\nEarlier, we said that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules bouncing against thewalls of the container. When we come later to make a more quantitative description, wewill wish to know how fast the molecules are going when they bounce, since the impactthey make will depend on that speed. We cannot, however, speak of the speed of themolecules. It is necessary to use a probability description. A molecule may have anyspeed, but some speeds are more likely than others. We describe what is going on bysaying that the probability that any particular molecule will have a speed between  and\\xa0 is , where\\xa0, a probability density, is a given function of the speed\\xa0.We shall see later how Maxwell, using common sense and the ideas of probability, was\\nx1 x2 P( <D< )x1 x2\\nŒîx\\nP( <D< )=‚àëp(x)Œîxx1 x2\\n= p(x)dx.‚à´\\nx2\\nx1\\n(6.18)\\nD x1x2 p(x) x1 x2\\nDx=‚àí‚àû x=+‚àû 1\\np(x)dx=1.‚à´\\n+‚àû\\n‚àí‚àû (6.19)\\nN‚àí‚àí‚àö1/ N‚àí‚àí‚àö 1\\np(x)= ,1\\nœÉ 2œÄ‚àí‚àí‚àö e‚àí /2x2 œÉ2 (6.20)\\nœÉ œÉ= N‚àí‚àí‚àö1 œÉ= N‚àí‚àí‚àö Srms\\nvv+Œîv p(v)Œîv p(v) v\\n3/29/25, 2:58 PM The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 6: Probability\\nhttps://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html 10/13'),\n",

We now believe that the ideas of probability are essential to a description ofatomic happenings.

Or if we try to force it to go very slowly, or at a precise velocity, it ‚Äúspreads out‚Äùso that we do not know very well just where it is. Particles behave in a funny way!\\nThe uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt todescribe nature. Our most precise description of nature must be in terms of probabilities.There are some people who do not like this way of describing nature. They feel somehowthat if they could only tell what is really going on with a particle, they could know itsspeed and position simultaneously. In the early days of the development of quantummechanics, Einstein was quite worried about this problem. He used to shake his head andsay, ‚ÄúBut, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!‚Äù Heworried about that problem for a long time and he probably never really reconciledhimself to the fact that this is the best description of nature that one can give. There arestill one or two physicists who are working on the problem who have an intuitiveconviction that it is possible somehow to describe the world in a different way and that allof this uncertainty about the way things are can be removed. No one has yet beensuccessful.\\nThe necessary uncertainty in our speciÔ¨Åcation of the position of a particle becomes mostimportant when we wish to describe the structure of atoms. In the hydrogen atom, whichhas a nucleus of one proton with one electron outside of the nucleus, the uncertainty inthe position of the electron is as large as the atom itself!

Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of itsvapor escape into the air. If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currentswill also carry the vapor with them. But even in perfectly still air, the vapor willgradually spread out‚Äîwill diffuse‚Äîuntil it has penetrated throughout the room. Wemight detect it by its color or odor. The individual molecules of the organic vapor spreadout in still air because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with othermolecules. If we know the average ‚Äústep‚Äù size, and the number of steps taken per second,we can Ô¨Ånd the probability that one, or several, molecules will be found at some distancefrom their starting point after any particular passage of time. As time passes, more stepsare taken and the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig.\\xa06‚Äì7. In a laterchapter, we shall Ô¨Ånd out how the step sizes and step frequencies are related to thetemperature and pressure of a gas.\\nEarlier, we said that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules bouncing against thewalls of the container. When we come later to make a more quantitative description, wewill wish to know how fast the molecules are going when they bounce, since the impactthey make will depend on that speed. We cannot, however, speak of the speed of themolecules. It is necessary to use a probability description. A molecule may have anyspeed, but some speeds are more likely than others. We describe what is going on bysaying that the probability that any particular molecule will have a speed between  and\\xa0 is , where\\xa0, a probability density, is a given function of the speed\\xa0.We shall see later how Maxwell, using common sense and the ideas of probability, was\\nx1 x2 P( <D< )x1 x2\\nŒîx\\nP( <D< )=‚àëp(x)Œîxx1 x2\\n= p(x)dx.‚à´\\nx2\\nx1\\n(6.18)\\nD x1x2 p(x) x1 x2\\nDx=‚àí‚àû x=+‚àû 1\\np(x)dx=1.‚à´\\n+‚àû\\n‚àí‚àû (6.19)\\nN‚àí‚àí‚àö1/ N‚àí‚àí‚àö 1\\np(x)= ,1\\nœÉ 2œÄ‚àí‚àí‚àö e‚àí /2x2 œÉ2 (6.20)\\nœÉ œÉ= N‚àí‚àí‚àö1 œÉ= N‚àí‚àí‚àö Srms\\nvv+Œîv p(v)Œîv p(v) v\\n3/29/25, 2:58 PM The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 6: Probability\\nhttps://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html 10/13'),\n",

Since witha gas we are usually dealing with large numbers of molecules, we expect the deviationsfrom the expected numbers to be small (like\\xa0), so we often neglect to say the‚Äúexpected‚Äù number, and say instead: ‚ÄúThe number of molecules with velocities between and\\xa0 is the area under the curve.‚Äù We should remember, however, that suchstatements are always about probable numbers.\\n6‚Äì5The uncertainty principle\\nThe ideas of probability are certainly useful in describing the behavior of the\\xa0 or somolecules in a sample of a gas, for it is clearly impractical even to attempt to write downthe position or velocity of each molecule.

We now believe that the ideas of probability are essential to a description ofatomic happenings. According to quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory ofparticles, there is always some uncertainty in the speciÔ¨Åcation of positions and velocities.We can, at best, say that there is a certain probability that any particle will have a positionnear some coordinate\\xa0.\\nWe can give a probability density\\xa0, such that\\xa0  is the probability that theparticle will be found between  and\\xa0 .

Or if we try to force it to go very slowly, or at a precise velocity, it ‚Äúspreads out‚Äùso that we do not know very well just where it is. Particles behave in a funny way!\\nThe uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt todescribe nature. Our most precise description of nature must be in terms of probabilities.There are some people who do not like this way of describing nature. They feel somehowthat if they could only tell what is really going on with a particle, they could know itsspeed and position simultaneously. In the early days of the development of quantummechanics, Einstein was quite worried about this problem. He used to shake his head andsay, ‚ÄúBut, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!‚Äù Heworried about that problem for a long time and he probably never really reconciledhimself to the fact that this is the best description of nature that one can give. There arestill one or two physicists who are working on the problem who have an intuitiveconviction that it is possible somehow to describe the world in a different way and that allof this uncertainty about the way things are can be removed. No one has yet beensuccessful.\\nThe necessary uncertainty in our speciÔ¨Åcation of the position of a particle becomes mostimportant when we wish to describe the structure of atoms. In the hydrogen atom, whichhas a nucleus of one proton with one electron outside of the nucleus, the uncertainty inthe position of the electron is as large as the atom itself! We cannot, therefore, properlyspeak of the electron moving in some ‚Äúorbit‚Äù around the proton.

      "In chapter 6 of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Richard Feynman discusses the concept of probability in physics. He explains that probability is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and cannot be avoided. Feynman highlights several key points related to probability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Probability densities: Feynman shows how probability densities can be used to describe the position and velocity of particles. He uses figures to illustrate the shape of these probabilities.\n",
      "2. Uncertainty principle: Feynman explains that there is a fundamental uncertainty in our specification of the position of a particle, which becomes particularly important when describing the structure of atoms. He notes that the number represents the \"typical\" radius of the atom.\n",
      "3. Independence of widths: Feynman highlights that if we try to force particles to have a precise velocity or be in a particular place, nature demands that there must be some uncertainty involved. This means that we cannot choose independently how narrow these curves are.\n",
      "4. Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Feynman explicitly states the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is greater than or equal to a certain constant (‚Ñè/2m).\n",
      "5. Probability of finding an electron at a distance from the nucleus: Feynman provides an example of how probability densities can be used to describe the location of an electron in an atom. He notes that there is a small probability of finding the electron at distances much greater than the typical radius of the atom.\n",
      "6. Funny way particles behave: Feynman states that there are still some physicists who work on removing this uncertainty, but no one has been successful. This highlights the idea that the uncertainty in position and momentum is an inherent aspect of quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Feynman emphasizes the importance of probability in quantum mechanics and how it affects our understanding of particle behavior. He shows how probability densities can be used to describe the position and velocity of particles, and how the uncertainty principle restricts how precisely we can determine these quantities."

       "['Feynman discussed the concept of probability in Chapter 6 of his \"Feynman Lectures on Physics.\" He explained that probability is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, and that particles behave in a way that is inherently uncertain.\\n\\nFeynman noted that the position and velocity of a particle cannot be precisely known at the same time, due to the uncertainty principle. He also discussed how the necessary uncertainty in our specification of the position of a particle becomes most important when describing the structure of atoms.\\n\\nFeynman stated that particles behave in a \"funny way\" and that there is an inherent fuzziness in any attempt to describe nature. He also noted that some physicists still work on the problem of removing this uncertainty, but no one has been successful so far.\\n\\nOverall, Feynman emphasized the importance of probability in quantum mechanics and the limitations of precision in describing the behavior of particles at the atomic level.',\n",
       " 'In his lecture on probability, Feynman mentions the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which implies that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously with infinite precision. He also notes that this principle forms the basis of quantum mechanics and that particles behave in a \"funny way\" due to this uncertainty.\\n\\nRegarding the second law of thermodynamics, Feynman does not directly address it in his lecture on probability. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system cannot decrease over time, it can only stay the same or increase. Entropy is a measure of the amount of thermal energy unavailable to do work in a system.\\n\\nHowever, Feynman does touch on related topics in his lectures, such as the concept of probability and the limitations of classical physics when attempting to describe quantum phenomena. These topics are relevant to understanding the second law of thermodynamics, which is a fundamental principle in the field of thermodynamics.']"
