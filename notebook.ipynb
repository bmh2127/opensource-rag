Why do we make guesses? We makeguesses when we wish to make a judgment but have incomplete information or uncertainknowledge. We want to make a guess as to what things are, or what things are likely tohappen. Often we wish to make a guess because we have to make a decision. Forexample: Shall I take my raincoat with me tomorrow? For what earth movement should Idesign a new building? Shall I build myself a fallout shelter? Shall I change my stand ininternational negotiations? Shall I go to class today?\\nSometimes we make guesses because we wish, with our limited knowledge, to say asmuch as we can about some situation. Really, any generalization is in the nature of aguess. Any physical theory is a kind of guesswork. There are good guesses and there arebad guesses. The theory of probability is a system for making better guesses. Thelanguage of probability allows us to speak quantitatively about some situation which maybe highly variable, but which does have some consistent average behavior.\\nLet us consider the ﬂipping of a coin. If the toss—and the coin—are “honest,” we haveno way of knowing what to expect for the outcome of any particular toss. Yet we wouldfeel that in a large number of tosses there should be about equal numbers of heads andtails. We say: “The probability that a toss will land heads is\\xa0.”\\nWe speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being made in thefuture. By the “probability” of a particular outcome of an observation we mean ourestimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yieldthat particular outcome. If we imagine repeating an observation—such as looking at afreshly tossed coin—\\xa0times, and if we call  our estimate of the most likely numberof our observations that will give some speciﬁed result\\xa0, say the result “heads,” then by\\xa0, the probability of observing\\xa0, we mean\\nOur deﬁnition requires several comments. First of all, we may speak of a probability ofsomething happening only if the occurrence is a possible outcome of some repeatableobservation. It is not clear that it would make any sense to ask: “What is the probabilitythat there is a ghost in that house?”\\nYou may object that no situation is exactly repeatable. That is right. Every differentobservation must at least be at a different time or place. All we can say is that the“repeated” observations should, for our intended purposes, appear to be equivalent. Weshould assume, at least, that each observation was made from an equivalently preparedsituation, and especially with the same degree of ignorance at the start. (If we sneak alook at an opponent’s hand in a card game, our estimate of our chances of winning aredifferent than if we do not!)\\nWe should emphasize that  and\\xa0  in Eq.\\xa0(6.1) are not intended to represent numbersbased on actual observations.  is our best estimate of what would occur in\\xa0imagined observations. Probability depends, therefore, on our knowledge and on ourability to make estimates. In effect, on our common sense! Fortunately, there is a certainamount of agreement in the common sense of many things, so that different people willmake the same estimate. Probabilities need not, however, be “absolute” numbers. Sincethey depend on our ignorance, they may become different if our knowledge changes.\\nYou may have noticed another rather “subjective” aspect of our deﬁnition of probability.We have referred to\\xa0 as “our estimate of the most likely number …” We do not meanthat we expect to observe exactly\\xa0 , but that we expect a number near\\xa0 , and that thenumber\\xa0 is more likely than any other number in the vicinity. If we toss a coin, say,\\xa0times, we should expect that the number of heads would not be very likely to beexactly\\xa0, but rather only some number near to\\xa0, say ,\\xa0 , , , , or\\xa0.However, if we must choose, we would decide that \\xa0heads is more likely than any othernumber.

It is theproblem of the “random walk.” In its simplest version, we imagine a “game” in which a“player” starts at the point\\xa0 and at each “move” is required to take a step eitherforward (toward\\xa0) or backward (toward\\xa0). The choice is to be made randomly,determined, for example, by the toss of a coin. How shall we describe the resultingmotion? In its general form the problem is related to the motion of atoms (or otherparticles) in a gas—called Brownian motion—and also to the combination of errors inmeasurements. You will see that the random-walk problem is closely related to the coin-tossing problem we have already discussed.\\nFirst, let us look at a few examples of a random walk. We may characterize the walker’sprogress by the net distance\\xa0 traveled in \\xa0steps. We show in the graph of Fig.\\xa06–5three examples of the path of a random walker. (We have used for the random sequenceof choices the results of the coin tosses shown in Fig.\\xa06–1.)\\nFig. 6–5.The progress made in a random walk. The horizontal coordinate\\xa0 is the totalnumber of steps taken; the vertical coordinate\\xa0 is the net distance moved from thestarting position.\\nWhat can we say about such a motion? We might ﬁrst ask: “How far does he get on theaverage?” We must expect that his average progress will be zero, since he is equallylikely to go either forward or backward. But we have the feeling that as\\xa0 increases, heis more likely to have strayed farther from the starting point. We might, therefore, askwhat is his average distance travelled in absolute value, that is, what is the average of\\xa0.

There is always the ﬁnitechance that a large ﬂuctuation—a long string of heads or tails—will give an arbitrarilylarge deviation. All we can say is that if the deviation is near the expected\\xa0 (saywithin a factor of  or\\xa0), we have no reason to suspect the honesty of the coin. If it ismuch larger, we may be suspicious, but cannot prove, that the coin is loaded (or that thetosser is clever!).\\nWe have also not considered how we should treat the case of a “coin” or some similar“chancy” object (say a stone that always lands in either of two positions) that we havegood reason to believe should have a different probability for heads and tails.

Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of itsvapor escape into the air. If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currentswill also carry the vapor with them. But even in perfectly still air, the vapor willgradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated throughout the room. Wemight detect it by its color or odor. The individual molecules of the organic vapor spreadout in still air because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with othermolecules. If we know the average “step” size, and the number of steps taken per second,we can ﬁnd the probability that one, or several, molecules will be found at some distancefrom their starting point after any particular passage of time. As time passes, more stepsare taken and the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig.\\xa06–7. In a laterchapter, we shall ﬁnd out how the step sizes and step frequencies are related to thetemperature and pressure of a gas.\\nEarlier, we said that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules bouncing against thewalls of the container. When we come later to make a more quantitative description, wewill wish to know how fast the molecules are going when they bounce, since the impactthey make will depend on that speed. We cannot, however, speak of the speed of themolecules. It is necessary to use a probability description. A molecule may have anyspeed, but some speeds are more likely than others. We describe what is going on bysaying that the probability that any particular molecule will have a speed between  and\\xa0 is , where\\xa0, a probability density, is a given function of the speed\\xa0.We shall see later how Maxwell, using common sense and the ideas of probability, was\\nx1 x2 P( <D< )x1 x2\\nΔx\\nP( <D< )=∑p(x)Δxx1 x2\\n= p(x)dx.∫\\nx2\\nx1\\n(6.18)\\nD x1x2 p(x) x1 x2\\nDx=−∞ x=+∞ 1\\np(x)dx=1.∫\\n+∞\\n−∞ (6.19)\\nN−−√1/ N−−√ 1\\np(x)= ,1\\nσ 2π−−√ e− /2x2 σ2 (6.20)\\nσ σ= N−−√1 σ= N−−√ Srms\\nvv+Δv p(v)Δv p(v) v\\n3/29/25, 2:58 PM The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 6: Probability\\nhttps://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html 10/13'),\n",

If we consider themolecules in a typical container (with a volume of, say, one liter), then there are a verylarge number\\xa0 of molecules present ().

Since witha gas we are usually dealing with large numbers of molecules, we expect the deviationsfrom the expected numbers to be small (like\\xa0), so we often neglect to say the“expected” number, and say instead: “The number of molecules with velocities between and\\xa0 is the area under the curve.” We should remember, however, that suchstatements are always about probable numbers.\\n6–5The uncertainty principle\\nThe ideas of probability are certainly useful in describing the behavior of the\\xa0 or somolecules in a sample of a gas, for it is clearly impractical even to attempt to write downthe position or velocity of each molecule. When probability was ﬁrst applied to suchproblems, it was considered to be a convenience—a way of dealing with very complexsituations. We now believe that the ideas of probability are essential to a description ofatomic happenings. According to quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory ofparticles, there is always some uncertainty in the speciﬁcation of positions and velocities.We can, at best, say that there is a certain probability that any particle will have a positionnear some coordinate\\xa0.\\nWe can give a probability density\\xa0, such that\\xa0  is the probability that theparticle will be found between  and\\xa0 .

Or if we try to force it to go very slowly, or at a precise velocity, it “spreads out”so that we do not know very well just where it is. Particles behave in a funny way!\\nThe uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt todescribe nature. Our most precise description of nature must be in terms of probabilities.There are some people who do not like this way of describing nature. They feel somehowthat if they could only tell what is really going on with a particle, they could know itsspeed and position simultaneously. In the early days of the development of quantummechanics, Einstein was quite worried about this problem. He used to shake his head andsay, “But, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!” Heworried about that problem for a long time and he probably never really reconciledhimself to the fact that this is the best description of nature that one can give. There arestill one or two physicists who are working on the problem who have an intuitiveconviction that it is possible somehow to describe the world in a different way and that allof this uncertainty about the way things are can be removed. No one has yet beensuccessful.\\nThe necessary uncertainty in our speciﬁcation of the position of a particle becomes mostimportant when we wish to describe the structure of atoms. In the hydrogen atom, whichhas a nucleus of one proton with one electron outside of the nucleus, the uncertainty inthe position of the electron is as large as the atom itself! We cannot, therefore, properlyspeak of the electron moving in some “orbit” around the proton. The most we can say isthat there is a certain chance\\xa0 , of observing the electron in an element ofvolume\\xa0 at the distance\\xa0 from the proton. The probability density\\xa0 is given by\\nquantum mechanics. For an undisturbed hydrogen atom . The number\\xa0is the “typical” radius, where the function is decreasing rapidly.

Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of itsvapor escape into the air. If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currentswill also carry the vapor with them. But even in perfectly still air, the vapor willgradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated throughout the room. Wemight detect it by its color or odor. The individual molecules of the organic vapor spreadout in still air because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with othermolecules. If we know the average “step” size, and the number of steps taken per second,we can ﬁnd the probability that one, or several, molecules will be found at some distancefrom their starting point after any particular passage of time. As time passes, more stepsare taken and the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig.\\xa06–7. In a laterchapter, we shall ﬁnd out how the step sizes and step frequencies are related to thetemperature and pressure of a gas.\\nEarlier, we said that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules bouncing against thewalls of the container. When we come later to make a more quantitative description, wewill wish to know how fast the molecules are going when they bounce, since the impactthey make will depend on that speed. We cannot, however, speak of the speed of themolecules. It is necessary to use a probability description. A molecule may have anyspeed, but some speeds are more likely than others. We describe what is going on bysaying that the probability that any particular molecule will have a speed between  and\\xa0 is , where\\xa0, a probability density, is a given function of the speed\\xa0.We shall see later how Maxwell, using common sense and the ideas of probability, was\\nx1 x2 P( <D< )x1 x2\\nΔx\\nP( <D< )=∑p(x)Δxx1 x2\\n= p(x)dx.∫\\nx2\\nx1\\n(6.18)\\nD x1x2 p(x) x1 x2\\nDx=−∞ x=+∞ 1\\np(x)dx=1.∫\\n+∞\\n−∞ (6.19)\\nN−−√1/ N−−√ 1\\np(x)= ,1\\nσ 2π−−√ e− /2x2 σ2 (6.20)\\nσ σ= N−−√1 σ= N−−√ Srms\\nvv+Δv p(v)Δv p(v) v\\n3/29/25, 2:58 PM The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 6: Probability\\nhttps://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html 10/13'),\n",

If we consider themolecules in a typical container (with a volume of, say, one liter), then there are a verylarge number\\xa0 of molecules present (). Since\\xa0  is the probability thatone molecule will have its velocity in\\xa0, by our deﬁnition of probability we mean thatthe expected number\\xa0  to be found with a velocity in the interval\\xa0 is given by\\nWe call  the “distribution in velocity.” The area under the curve between twovelocities  and\\xa0, for example the shaded area in Fig.\\xa06–9, represents [for the curve\\xa0] the expected number of molecules with velocities between  and\\xa0. Since witha gas we are usually dealing with large numbers of molecules, we expect the deviationsfrom the expected numbers to be small (like\\xa0), so we often neglect to say the“expected” number, and say instead: “The number of molecules with velocities between and\\xa0 is the area under the curve.” We should remember, however, that suchstatements are always about probable numbers.\\n6–5The uncertainty principle\\nThe ideas of probability are certainly useful in describing the behavior of the\\xa0 or somolecules in a sample of a gas, for it is clearly impractical even to attempt to write downthe position or velocity of each molecule. When probability was ﬁrst applied to suchproblems, it was considered to be a convenience—a way of dealing with very complexsituations. We now believe that the ideas of probability are essential to a description ofatomic happenings. According to quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory ofparticles, there is always some uncertainty in the speciﬁcation of positions and velocities.We can, at best, say that there is a certain probability that any particle will have a positionnear some coordinate\\xa0.\\nWe can give a probability density\\xa0, such that\\xa0  is the probability that theparticle will be found between  and\\xa0 . If the particle is reasonably well localized,say near\\xa0, the function\\xa0 might be given by the graph of Fig.\\xa06–10(a).

Or if we try to force it to go very slowly, or at a precise velocity, it “spreads out”so that we do not know very well just where it is. Particles behave in a funny way!\\nThe uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt todescribe nature. Our most precise description of nature must be in terms of probabilities.There are some people who do not like this way of describing nature. They feel somehowthat if they could only tell what is really going on with a particle, they could know itsspeed and position simultaneously. In the early days of the development of quantummechanics, Einstein was quite worried about this problem. He used to shake his head andsay, “But, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!” Heworried about that problem for a long time and he probably never really reconciledhimself to the fact that this is the best description of nature that one can give. There arestill one or two physicists who are working on the problem who have an intuitiveconviction that it is possible somehow to describe the world in a different way and that allof this uncertainty about the way things are can be removed. No one has yet beensuccessful.\\nThe necessary uncertainty in our speciﬁcation of the position of a particle becomes mostimportant when we wish to describe the structure of atoms. In the hydrogen atom, whichhas a nucleus of one proton with one electron outside of the nucleus, the uncertainty inthe position of the electron is as large as the atom itself! We cannot, therefore, properlyspeak of the electron moving in some “orbit” around the proton.
